I have been active on that popular business-focused social network recently...

But first, here is a memory: I visited Baku a long time ago. Along the road when coming from the airport, there was a newly built wall. I learnt that it was a wall that so conveniently left poverty on the other side.

I see that wall everywhere now. And poverty is not the only thing it hides.

...

So, I have been active on that popular *business-focused* social network recently. I find the content interesting, but the experience a bit disturbing.

By experience, I mean the contrast: The contrast between the collective feelings of humanity vs. the feelings boosted in a business networking platform.

Especially nowadays.

The platform manages to successfully isolate itself from discussions on the larger troubles of humanity, simply by piggybacking on the workplace etiquette. And the user base supports this. You could claim that this is just people filtering what they share based on platform. But let's be honest: **We both know that's not the case here.** In time, we all become this carefully-curated people.

The platform doesn't even try to prevent us. This collective behaviour is just a reflection of *what* we feel comfortable *being*: We are the white collar. We subscribe to an idea of a "workplace etiquette" that not only isolates businesses themselves from world events, it even isolates the social platforms about business from them. We are *professionals*. Professionalism, as a perfect excuse to avoid risky topics.

This is wrong.

Not sharing memes in a business network is good. Not boosting information about world events is not.

Many of us in there were lucky (and driven) enough to receive good education. Education that would maybe help in accurately challenging the status-quo where it matters. But the society kindly, and constantly, hints us to not do it.[^1] It reminds me of something Kafka said:

> Atlas was permitted the opinion that he was at liberty, if he wished, to drop the Earth and creep away; but this opinion was all that he was permitted.

That's all for today. Thanks.

[^1]: That is, unless challenging that particular status-quo is the currently accepted trend.

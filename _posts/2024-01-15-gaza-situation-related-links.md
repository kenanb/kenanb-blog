Some links and quotes relating to the situation in Gaza.

100 days have passed since this started.

## Situation Report from UNICEF

First of all, here is the latest Palestine situation report from UNICEF: [State of Palestine Humanitarian Situation Report No. 14 (Escalation), 10 January 2024][unicef-situation-report]

Quoting from the PDF report:

> As of 9 January, at least 23,210 Palestinians were reported killed in the Gaza Strip since the start of hostilities, including
more than 5,350 children (disaggregated data as of 20 November). More than 57,035 Palestinians were reported injured,
including at least 10,787 children (partially disaggregated data as of 31 December). Thousands of children continue to
be reported missing and are likely to be injured or killed under the rubble of destroyed buildings.

Let me repeat that: **... "at least 23,210 Palestinians were reported killed" ... "including more than 5,350 children" ....**

This is in 100 days.

You can find UNICEF's [Gaza appeal here][unicef-gaza].

## South Africa v. Israel (Genocide Convention)

Here is the case overview page on [International Court of Justice][wikipedia-icj] webpage: [Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip (South Africa v. Israel)][icj-case-overview]

Quoting the Wikipedia page "[South Africa v. Israel (Genocide Convention)][wikipedia-convention]":

> The proceedings instituted by South Africa against the State of Israel on 29 December 2023 before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), officially known as Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip (South Africa v. Israel), allege that Israel has committed, and is committing, genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, in violation of the Genocide Convention.

[Proceedings section][wikipedia-convention-proceedings] states:
> A final judgement on the case could take years.

Public hearings were held on 11 and 12 January. Here are links to recordings, from UN youtube account:
- [South Africa levels accusations of ‘genocidal conduct’ against Israel at UN Int'l Court of Justice][youtube-un-hearing-1]
- [Israel's Oral Argument: South Africa v. Israel at UN Int'l Court of Justice Public Hearings][youtube-un-hearing-2]

## Actors Reading the Case File

Many actors contributed to a video series reading portions of the case file ([available in ICJ page][icj-case-institution-proceedings]). There is a [Hollywood Reporter][hw-actors-read-case-file] news article on this. Here are the links to the videos in the series that I found so far:
- [Part 1][youtube-palfest-p1]
- [Part 2][youtube-palfest-p2]
- [Part 3][youtube-palfest-p3]

That's all I will share today.

I first read about this at: [Using Uninitialized Memory for Fun and Profit][swtch-sparse].

Clever.

It is particularly suitable for some compiler use-cases.

Unsurprisingly, there is an [LLVM implementation][llvm-impl], which has a nice summary of the data structure:
> SparseSet - Fast set implementation for objects that can be identified by
> small unsigned keys.
>
> SparseSet allocates memory proportional to the size of the key universe, so
> it is not recommended for building composite data structures.  It is useful
> for algorithms that require a single set with fast operations.

Briggs and Torczon's original paper [^1] is an easy read. [PDF is accessible on ACM.][briggs-torczon-pdf]

[^1]: Briggs, Torczon, "An efficient representation for sparse sets", ACM Letters on Programming Languages and Systems, Volume 2 Issue 1-4, March-Dec. 1993.

I also found it in [Rust standard library][rust-std].

Over the years, I encountered a few cases where this could have been applied, but I kept forgetting how to search for it. :smile: Cardinality was often 64.

Maybe I will run some tests in Part 2.

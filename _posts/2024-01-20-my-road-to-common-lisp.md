How I got into Lisp family of languages, specifically Common Lisp.

I think it was the second year in university when I first read about Lisp. I wrote some JS, and C quite a few years earlier.

I was trying to explore the scripting capabilities of [AutoCAD][wikipedia-autocad]. I borrowed 2 books from the university library: one about [AutoLISP][wikipedia-autolisp], the other, [Common Lisp][wikipedia-common-lisp]. I was originally after some pragmatic learning to help with my design projects in architecture school, but Lisp was just too fun to stop reading. It revived my interest in programming. [S-expressions][wikipedia-s-expression], [CLOS][wikipedia-clos], [MOP][wikipedia-metaobject-mop], macros, I kept reading.

I became a regular in the relevant IRC channels. I prototyped many unfinished projects in Lisp as a hobbyist. I mainly used Common Lisp. I wrote some Emacs Lisp, and a bit of Scheme, too.

I only used Lisp for hobby projects so far. I got to write less and less of it in the last decade. But they say learning Lisp makes you a better programmer even if you don't use it professionally. I believe that.[^1]

I will spare you the long-form Common Lisp evangelism. The language has its flaws, but it is really good!

More about that tomorrow. Thanks for reading!

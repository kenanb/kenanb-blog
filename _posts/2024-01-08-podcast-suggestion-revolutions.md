"Revolutions" is a very well-known history podcast by [Mike Duncan][wikipedia-mike-duncan].

The series had its final episode in late 2022, after 11 seasons.

I have been listening to it for a few years now. It is just an incredibly good narration of the history of revolutions across the world.

You can find the list of revolutions each season is dedicated to [in this Wikipedia page][wikipedia-revolutions-seasons].

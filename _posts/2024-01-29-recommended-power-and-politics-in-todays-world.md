Power and Politics in Today’s World is a Yale course by Ian Shapiro.

I really appreciate freely available course content from universities.

"Power and Politics in Today’s World" is a course taught by professor [Ian Shapiro][wikipedia-ian-shapiro]. The recordings are available on [YaleCourses][yt-yale-courses] YouTube channel. Here is [the link to the course playlist][yt-playlist].

I only watched a few recordings so far, but I found the lectures very insightful. An example: [here is a part from Lecture 7][yt-referandum] about the logic of referandum politics.
